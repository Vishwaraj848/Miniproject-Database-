Moving on, this blood bank management system project in PHP focuses 
mainly on dealing with donors regarding their donation stuff. Also, it 
displays all the available data such as blood details, donor lists, 
announcements, and campaigns. The project is divided into two categories: 
Admin Login, and Donor’s Login. In an overview of this web app, the admin 
has full control of the system. Talking about the project, an admin can 
simply log in where he/she can manage the details of all available records. 
For adding blood details, the admin should provide the donor’s name, 
gender, date of birth, weight, contact information, blood quantity with the 
collection date.
The system also allows managing donor data by providing his/her identity 
details with blood group, weight, contact information. Under this section, an 
admin has to create an account for the donor so that the donor can use 
his/her account separately whenever he wants to contribute some. Besides 
this, there are certain categories such as Announcements and Campaigns. 
After creating announcements and campaigns, it makes aware of the 
upcoming events and required types of blood during rush hours as it helps 
to alert them. At last, the system also illustrates a summary of available 
blood according to blood groups in form of pie-chart representation.
